A beginner's path toward a Web Dev full time Web Specialist, freelancer...
This is a place to record the steps I take to reach my goal: 6 months time span since Oct,01,2022 to March,31,2013.
Guide and rules: 
1. One time, a path. Start with Odin Project.  
2. 3 rounds. 
    1. First round, skim through all the courses. SKIM, Core concepts are two Key Words. So the point: follow the tutorial, read the assignment articles, write down the "skeleton" note of each section, do the necessary projects and followup question in each section. 
    2. Second round, pay attention to the "hard but necessary core concepts". Redo all the Projects. 
    3. Third round... Just move ahead and comment later.
