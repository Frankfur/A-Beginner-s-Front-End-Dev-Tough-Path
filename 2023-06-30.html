Now I plan to embark on the Cloud computing journey. My decision is based on the following considerations: 
1. Cloud  computing will be the "gas and electricity" in new era and trend is becoming apparent as years pass by. 
2. The financial return for the related careear is handsome compared to other career choices. 
3. A level playground for all participants from all over the globe.  High transferable skills; 
4. Common practices to work remotely in this field. 

Surely, there is no shortages of challenges. But I am ready for those.
